        Josh Decker is a trumpet performer and educator currently residing in central Ohio. His playing career has been
        both

        Other career highlights include extensive work with Columbus' Short North Stage Musical Company, Bach Choir of
        Pittsburgh, and a three week residency at the children's theme park, Dutch Wonderland in Lancaster, PA.
    </p>
    <p>
        Josh's musical interests and expertise lead him to co-founding Pittsburgh's brass-funk band, the Employees of
        Funk,
        a group in which he composed original material, arrangements, and played trumpet in from 2015-2017.
    </p>

        As a soloist, Josh performed the National Anthem at the NCAA track and field national championships in 2013.

        Gahanna,
        Dublin, and Olentangy school districts ranging from 8-18 years of age.
    </p>

    <p>
        Numerous students of Josh's have had success at OMEA Solo and Ensemble competitions, as well as hold spots in
        the
        city's best youth ensembles, including Columbus Youth Symphony Orchestra, Columbus Youth Jazz Orchestra and the
        Columbus Youth Symphonic Band.
    </p>

        In the Summer of 2019, Josh directed the Music Royale Brass Camp, an immersive week-long camp that exposed young
        brass musicians to a multi-genre ensemble experience.

    <p>Josh holds a BM in Music Education from Ohio Wesleyan University and a Masters of Music in trumpet performance
        from
